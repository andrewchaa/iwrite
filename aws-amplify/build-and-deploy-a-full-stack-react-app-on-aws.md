# Build and deploy a full-stack react app on AWS

from [https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-react-app-amplify-graphql/](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-react-app-amplify-graphql/)

Created a new react app first.

```bash
npx create-react-app keid
cd keid
npm start
```

Then commit the code and push it to Github. 

```bash
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/reponame.git
git add .
git commit -m “initial commit”
git push origin main
```

Recently, Github changed their default branch to main. 

Go to amplify and follow Get Started on "Deliver with the amplify console"
